Per requrements I used the JavaScript Fetch API
to make a request to the NASA API and get the Astronomy
Picture of the Day.
Error handling is added to the function.
An attend was made to create a skeleton loader, but it is not very good implemented.
Just open the index.html file and the API response will be seen in the browser.
